# Portfolio Project: Personal Web Application for Article Management

As a front-end developer preparing for a career in the industry, I have built a web application utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Supabase. This application allows users to add URLs, categories, and texts of articles they have read throughout the day, providing a streamlined way to manage and track their learning progress.
